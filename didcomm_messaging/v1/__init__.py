"""DIDComm v1 Interfaces.

These components are intended to provide a similar structure to the DIDComm v2
interfaces provided by this library. While the community is transitioning from
DIDComm v1 to v2, having a consistent interface to interact with will help
implementers to support both versions until the transition is complete.

It is expected that a future version of this library will eventually remove
these interfaces.
